                            <p>Beginner-level questions gauge users' familiarity with the fundamentals of a given service, its place among other services and how it connects with them, and its general use cases. The beginner level is the one level where questions can solely focus on what the service is, whereas Intermediate and Advanced questions focus on how to best use the service(s) based on different business and technical objectives. Beginner level questions are useful for people with some computing experience, but who are new to a specific service or cloud computing.</p>

                        <p>Intermediate-level questions gauge the prerequisite and fundamental knowledge of distributed computing and cloud service architectures, as well as the basic understanding of how a given service functions. Intermediate level questions focus on assessing the user's understanding of how to use the service to achieve basic tasks such as planning and designing cloud architecture, creating applications for the cloud, and maintaining a secure, stable and cost-effective cloud service. Intermediate level questions are useful for people who understand how cloud computing works, and have some familiarity with services, but are expanding their knowledge to new areas.</p>

Advanced questions assess users on complex concepts and often provide scenarios with multiple (sometimes competing) variables that require the user to weigh trade-offs and think critically to analyze a given situation.</p>
